# Icons

Most icons are displayed using `LucideAngularModule`. 
However, some custom icons that are not provided by Lucide are provided by creating components in this directory.

Custom icons must contain an svg element and extend the `Icon` class 
so that the `.app-icon` class can be assigned to the component element.
